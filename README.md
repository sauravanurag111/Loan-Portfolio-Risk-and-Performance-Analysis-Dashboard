# LoanRiskAnalysis

This project involves analyzing and visualizing loan data to derive actionable insights for financial institutions. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to understand loan trends, borrower behavior, and risk factors. The analysis uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

*Key Features*
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and formatting dates.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summaries, data distribution, and correlations.
- Visualizations: Scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to explore relationships and distributions. Enhanced plots such as regression lines and pairplots for in-depth analysis.

Results
Interest Rates vs Loan Amount: Analyzed and visualized the relationship between interest rates and loan amounts.
Loan Amount by Employment Length: Investigated the distribution of loan amounts across different employment lengths.
Good vs Bad Loans: Classified loans based on performance and visualized their distribution.
Bubble Plot: Added dimensions like loan amount to the scatterplot for more insights.
